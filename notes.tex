\section{Local News and National Politics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The amount invested in covering local politics is diminishing. This paper explores whether this is a supply-side (who runs media stations) or a demand-side (what people want from their local stations) phenomenon.
	\item Analyzes the content of 743 local stations during late 2017, when many were bought by the Sinclair Broadcast Group.
	\item Measures program content using an LDA approach
	\item DID is used to estimate an ATT among the treated stations (those acquired by Sinclair)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finds that Sinclair buying a station was associated with a three percentage point increase in the coverage of national news at the expense of local news. News coverage also shifted rightwards as a result of Sinclair taking ownership.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{The Fox News Effect Media Bias and Voting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Uses a DID approach to estimate the effect of Fox News entering a county on election outcomes. TL;DR, Republicans Gaines between a .4 and .7 percentage boost in towns that Fox News joined.
\end{itemize}

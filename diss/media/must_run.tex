                    \textbf{(A):} But we're concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media.

                    \textbf{(B):} More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories... stories that just aren't true, without checking facts first.

                    \textbf{(A):} Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control 'exactly what people think'...This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.
